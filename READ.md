This is the beginning. The start of my game development journey.
This is Part One of a Udemy course that teaches how to use Phaser and JS to develop games.
In this repository I will do a code along where I create a Flappy Bird Clone where I will learn how to:
- Manipulate physical concepts like gravity and velocity
- Create different game objects
- Learn how to re-use game objects by recycling
- Track score
- Create scenes such as: Menu screen, score screen, pause screen and play scene
